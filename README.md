With the aim of expanding my knowledge on ML and the different models and procedures, 
I am following the index from the "Python Machine Learning, Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili".
The book's content ethroughly explains all the different ML algorithms for Classification and Regression models and more advance content. 
I am completing my studies with the Master on Big Data from the Distance University of Spain. Exercises from that Master are posted here as well.
Also, my aim is to get into different databases, apply the knowledge and try to dig deeper into other concepts that I might find interesting.
