With the aim of expanding my knowledge on ML and the different models and procedures, 
I am following the index from the "Python Machine Learning, Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili".
The content follows a through approach across the different ML algorithms for Classification and Regression models. 
I am completing my studies with the Master on Big Data from the Distance University of Spain. Exercises from that Master are posted here as well.
Also, my aim is to get into different databases, apply the knowledge and try to dig deepder into other concepts tha tI might find interesting.
